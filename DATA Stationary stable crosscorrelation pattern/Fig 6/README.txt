STATIONARY PATTERNS

-
The files: 
CORRELATION_OF_STATIONARY PATTERNS_INTER and CORRELATION_OF_STATIONARY PATTERNS_INTRA 

contain the data for the Gran Matrix in Figure 6.

They show correlations of the stationary patterns for all subjects (C=13, U=13, S=10)
and the three physiological conditions (Control, UWS, SLEEP).

These data are used for both intra and inter cumulative analyses.
