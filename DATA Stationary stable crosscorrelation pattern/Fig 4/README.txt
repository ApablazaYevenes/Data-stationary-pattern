-CORRELATION OF AVERAGED CORRELATION MATRICES-
--


This folder contains the data used to obtain image 4:

"GRANMATRIX OF CORRELATION of averaged correlation matrices" (sleep, UWS, control):
These files contain the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices, which are used to generate cumulative data.

CONTROL
The red quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of control subjects res-rhy.
The green quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of control subjects res-ar.
The purple quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of control subjects rhy-ar.

UWS
The red quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of UWS subjects res-rhy.
The green quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of UWS subjects res-ar.
The purple quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of UWS subjects rhy-ar.

SLEEP
The red quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of sleep stage 2-4 subjects.
The green quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of sleep stage 2-REM subjects.
The purple quadrant represents the correlations from the averaged correlation matrices of sleep stage 4-REM subjects.


--------------------------------------------------------------
The files named "CORRELATION of correlation matrices averaged" (sleep, UWS, control): contain the selection of correlations from the same subject between 2 physiological conditions (diagonal elements marked in color and extracted from the previously mentioned matrix). Cumulative data is generated from these correlations of averaged correlation matrices.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The file STATIONARY PATTERNS is used to create the box plots. It contains the non-diagonal elements of each of the matrices called "stationary pattern" for each subject under each of the physiological conditions CONTROL, UWS, SLEEP.


These data are organized according to the presentation of the stationary patterns in Figure 5.
